## Weekly progress reports
### Report 1

What I did in the last week:
* Learned about different software engineering and data science process methodologies and what considerations should be made when selecting the appropriate model for a project.
* Wrote down points about the coursework question on the target audience, experience of the team in these methodologies, business goals and problems.
* Read up in-depth on Agile, Scrum, Data Driven Scrum and Team Data Science Process.

What I plan to do in the next week:
* Finalise a methodology to use.
* Draft a persona and problem statement.
* Brainstorm questions that can be explored with the data set.

Issues blocking my progress (state ‘None’ if there are no issues):
* I am unsure whether we should choose a more data science focused methodology or a software engineering one.
