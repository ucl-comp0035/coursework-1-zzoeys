# Coursework 2

Most students will use the same repository for coursework 2. You may use this file to present the results of that
coursework if you wish. Alternatively you can use video or audio to provide the explanations instead of writing them.

## Requirements definition and analysis
The term 'requirements' is used in the broader sense, user stories and/or use cases may be used.

### Requirements identification methods

Firstly, a context diagram is built to gain insight into interface requirements. This is a form of interface analysis, a BABOK elicitation technique (International Institute of Business Analysis, 2015), and it enables the understanding of the users that send and receive data to and from the system at a high-level of abstraction. 

Ideally, a focus group would also be conducted with aspiring business owners to learn about their requirements for the web application. During a focus group, participants can build on the responses of others and comment on any differing opinions. This makes focus groups useful for understanding a collective view (Kitzinger, 1995) and would allow the product team to gain an understanding of the aspiring business owners’ needs and how the proposed web application can best support these needs. 

However, due to ethical and time restrictions, brainstorming will be used instead of focus groups. The context diagram will guide the process of brainstorming so that requirements of all users of the system can be identified.

### Requirement specification method

Data Driven Scrum (DDS) was chosen as the project methodology to guide the use of sprint planning as DDS is an agile methodology and a core principle of agile development is developing software that is user-focused. Thus, user stories was chosen as the method of requirement specification as they keep the product team focused on the value of their software’s features and how they address a particular need of the client (https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/user-stories). User stories articulate the desired purpose of the system and provide the basis for communication and collaboration between the product team about the user’s requirements. User stories are also meant to be easily understood and revised, which is helpful for an inexperienced product team like that of this project.

### Prioritisation method

### Documented and prioritised requirements
Link to the full list of documented and prioritised requirements.

Trello was used, here. Click the labels at the top of each card to see the name of the labels.



## Design
### Structure and flow of the interface

#### User flows

#### Wireframes

Lucidchart was used to create the wireframes for the web app. As the user of the web app would tend to use their laptops to access the app instead of other devices like their mobile phone, the sketch would assume the user is accessing the web app on their laptop.

#### Class diagram

A class diagram was created for a high level view of the classes and the relationships between the classes. Their attributes and methods of each class are also detailed in the diagram. [detail whether a data-driven driven approach was chosen https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=3191437]


#### Routes


### Relational database design

#### Conceptual Design
An ERD diagram is created.

#### Logical Design

### Application structure


## Testing
### Choice of unit testing library

### Tests
The tests should be in a separate and appropriately named file/directory.

### Test results
Provide evidence that the tests have been run and the results of the tests (e.g. screenshot).

### Continuous integration 
Consider using GitHub Actions (or other) to establish a continuous integration pipeline. If you do so then please provide a link to the .yml and a screenshot of the results of a workflow run.
